# JSON Parser

This project is one of the [Coding Challenge](https://codingchallenges.substack.com/p/coding-challenge-2)

## What does this application do?

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Concepts

JSON means JavaScript Object Notation, it is the best format data to interchange, because of yout lightweigth and flexibility.



## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
